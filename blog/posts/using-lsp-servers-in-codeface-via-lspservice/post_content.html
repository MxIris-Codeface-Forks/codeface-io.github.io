LSPService is a free open source webservice that can provide <a href="../../../index.html">Codeface</a> finer granularity and information about actual architecture:

<br><br>

For example, it allows <a href="../../../index.html">Codeface</a> to show the symbols (like classes and functions) and dependencies in your code base.

<h2>Download and Run</h2>

Simply download LSPService and run it locally on your machine. <a href="../../../index.html">Codeface</a> will automatically detect LSPService and talk to it.

On you first attempt to launch LSPService, you'll probably need to confirm that intention via the security settings:

LSPService will run in terminal, and as long as it's running there, the service is available. Check <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.

<h2>Add Language Support</h2>

If Xcode is installed, LSPService automatically supports <b>Swift packages</b>. Be aware that using LSPService and Codeface on Swift packages, you have to `swift build` your package from the console to update what LSPService and Codeface "can see". This is due to a <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp#caveats">caveat</a> of <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp">Apple's LSP server</a>, which is still at an early stage.

<br><br>

The same LSP server from Apple should also work for Objective-c, C++ and C (see below).

<br><br>

Generally, you must provide locations of <a href="https://langserver.org">LSP servers</a> for the languages you care about: LSPService creates an LSPServiceConfig.json file on launch if the file doesn't exist yet. If the file exists, LSPService loads server configurations from the file. The JSON structure is quite self-explanatory:

<pre><code>{
    "swift" : {
        "path" : "/usr/bin/xcrun",
        "arguments" : [
            "sourcekit-lsp"
        ],
        "environment" : {
            "SOURCEKIT_LOGGING" : "0"
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

Just add language server entries to the file and then restart LSPService. Arguments and environment may of course remain empty.

<br><br>

In the future, LSPService will help more with installing and locating LSP servers for common languages. Learn more (or even contribute) <a href="https://github.com/flowtoolz/LSPService">on GitHub</a>.
